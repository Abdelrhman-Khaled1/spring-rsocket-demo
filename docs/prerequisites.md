# What You'll Need

To practice these recipes, you'll need a few things.

## Java

To follow along with this tutorial you'll need Java installed on your PC. You can find out if you have Java by opening a command-line and typing `java -version`. If you don't have Java already, you can get it from [AdoptOpenJDK][adopt-open-jdk]. If you're a developer, you might want to consider using [SDKMan][sdkman] instead. When installing, choose a recent version such as Java 11 or Java 8 (but no lower).

## Git

You'll also need to [download and install Git][git] so that you can clone the code repository. 

## Bash/GitBash/ZSH

There are some scripts provided in the source code repository that require a Linux terminal to run. If you're on Windows, you can use [Git Bash][gitbash] or you can check out the scripts and apply some of your Windows Command Prompt expertise to get them running in Dos or PowerShell.
